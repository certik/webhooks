<h1>About</h1>

<p>
This is a web application that provides an alternative interface to the
repositories hosted at <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>
It uses the GitHub <a href="http://develop.github.com/">web API</a> to access
information about the repositories and then caches it in the database
(everything runs on the
<a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>), so it's
very fast.
</p>
<p>
This application is opensource (BSD licensed), source code is at
<a href="http://github.com/certik/webhooks">http://github.com/certik/webhooks</a>
</p>

<h1>Add a repository</h1>
To add a new repository, set up a post-receive hook on your repository as
explained in the
<a href="http://github.com/guides/post-receive-hooks">Post-Receive Guide</a>
at GitHub. This is important, so that we are kept updated about all changes to
the repository.
