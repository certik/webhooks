  <h3>How to add a repository and users</h3>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
    To add a new repository, set up a post-receive hook on your repository (use
the url of this page) as explained in the <a
href="http://github.com/guides/post-receive-hooks">Post-Receive Guide</a> at
GitHub. That's the best way, because we will be kept updated about all changes
to the repository.

    Once we receive a hook, the corresponding repository and users will be
automatically created.
    </p>
    <p>
    Another option is to create the repository manually on the
    <a href="/hooks/repos/">repositories list</a>
    page.

<h1>About</h1>

<p>
This is a web application that provides an alternative interface to the
repositories hosted at <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>
It uses the GitHub <a href="http://develop.github.com/">web API</a> to access
information about the repositories and then caches it in the database
(everything runs on the
<a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>), so it's
very fast.
</p>
<p>
This application is opensource (BSD licensed), source code is at
<a href="http://github.com/certik/webhooks">http://github.com/certik/webhooks</a>
